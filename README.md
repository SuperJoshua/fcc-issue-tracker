# Build an Issue Tracker

[--> How it should look](https://issue-tracker.freecodecamp.rocks/)

This was a project required for getting the Quality Assurance Certificate from freeCodeCamp. It had to pass these tests.

- You can send a POST request to /api/issues/{projectname} with form data containing the required fields issue_title, issue_text, created_by, and optionally assigned_to and status_text.
- The POST request to /api/issues/{projectname} will return the created object, and must include all of the submitted fields. Excluded optional fields will be returned as empty strings. Additionally, include created_on (date/time), updated_on (date/time), open (boolean, true for open - default value, false for closed), and _id.
- If you send a POST request to /api/issues/{projectname} without the required fields, returned will be the error { error: 'required field(s) missing' }
- You can send a GET request to /api/issues/{projectname} for an array of all issues for that specific projectname, with all the fields present for each issue.
- You can send a GET request to /api/issues/{projectname} and filter the request by also passing along any field and value as a URL query (ie. /api/issues/{project}?open=false). You can pass one or more field/value pairs at once.
- You can send a PUT request to /api/issues/{projectname} with an _id and one or more fields to update. On success, the updated_on field should be updated, and returned should be {  result: 'successfully updated', '_id': _id }.
- When the PUT request sent to /api/issues/{projectname} does not include an _id, the return value is { error: 'missing _id' }.
- When the PUT request sent to /api/issues/{projectname} does not include update fields, the return value is { error: 'no update field(s) sent', '_id': _id }. On any other error, the return value is { error: 'could not update', '_id': _id }.
- You can send a DELETE request to /api/issues/{projectname} with an _id to delete an issue. If no _id is sent, the return value is { error: 'missing _id' }. On success, the return value is { result: 'successfully deleted', '_id': _id }. On failure, the return value is { error: 'could not delete', '_id': _id }.
- All 14 functional tests are complete and passing.
